# TwitchToolkit

As you may know, I'm a streamer on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/LLCoolChris_).

This project keep my control desktop software + the website I'm using as an overlay.

This is also a playground to play with Twitch API.

I don't plan to do an installation procedure here, but feel free to explore!
